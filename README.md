# 05-Matplotlib-HW
Matplotlib homework.
I this assignment, I analyze mock pharmaceutical data from a study of 250 mice who were treated with a variety of drug regimes over a period of 45 days. The objective of this project is to analyze the data to show how the four treatments compare to each other.

For the analysis, I used Pandas and Matplotlib to:

    -Create a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
    -Create a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
    -Create a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
    -Create a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
